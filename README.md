This simple TODO list application is designed to demonstrate how applications can be built to use the CloudOS in the personal cloud application architecture (PCAA). This [blog post](http://www.windley.com) describes the contents of this repository in detail. 

You may also want to play with the [Forever application](http://forevr.us/) which uses this same architecture and read the [Personal Cloud Application Architecture white paper](http://www.windley.com/liveweb/forever/) to understand more details. 

The TODO list application and Forever both make use of the [CloudOS.js library](https://github.com/kynetx/CloudOS.js) to speak to personal clouds based on CloudOS. The example personal cloud platform we use is [SquareTag](https://squaretag.com/), but any CloudOS-based personal cloud should work.  The goal is to have applications written in a PCAA-style that can link to a variety of personal clouds.
